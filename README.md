## 🧐 About The Project

Optimization algorithms are the engines behind training neural networks, but understanding how they behave on different surfaces can be unintuitive. **Optimizer Playground** is a web-based tool designed to visualize the path taken by various algorithms (like Gradient Descent, Adam, etc.) as they attempt to find the global minimum of a function.

This project is perfect for:
* Students learning about Machine Learning and calculus.
* Developers wanting to visualize the effect of learning rates and momentum.
* Anyone curious about the math behind AI.

## ✨ Features

* **Interactive Visualization:** Watch the optimizers move in real-time across the contour plots.
* **Multiple Algorithms:** Compare the performance of different optimizers side-by-side.
* **Adjustable Hyperparameters:** Tweak the Learning Rate, Epochs, and more to see how they impact convergence.
* **Browser-Based:** Runs entirely on the client side—no installation required.

## 🛠️ Built With

* **HTML/CSS/JavaScript:** Core application logic.
* **GitHub Pages:** Hosting and deployment.
